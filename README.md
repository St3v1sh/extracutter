# Extracutter

This Minecraft 1.20.1 to 1.20.4 datapack adds extra recipes to the stonecutter.

### Oh no! You cut all your [insert generic stone] blocks into stairs!

Do not worry; Extracutter has come to your rescue!

### Reversable stonecutter recipes.

With extracutter, you can simply cut all your stairs back into regular blocks... or into chiseled blocks... or into bricks... you get the idea.

## Usage

Download the datapack from the [releases tab](https://github.com/sky3947/extracutter/releases) or build `extracutter.zip` yourself with the following command (you must have npm):

```bash
npm i && node .
```
